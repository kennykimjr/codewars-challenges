## How to Use

If you are stuck on a particular kata, this repository may be of some use. I have compiled my own set of solutions to Katas that I have completed. Each of the files contains its own kata solution, denoted by the file name structure:

```kata-<hash>.js```

You can find this hash inside the url as end part of the url. Example:

``` https://www.codewars.com/kata/556deca17c58da83c00002db ```

The hash would be **556deca17c58da83c00002db**

Go to the solutions folder and then search by this hash.

Remember that this should primarily be used as a tool to understand **one** possible route to the solution. Often times in CodeWars there is no one correct solution. Try coming up with a solution that may run even better than the one that I have made!
